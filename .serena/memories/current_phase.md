## 🎓 Key Learning: Git Branch Management

**Question You Asked:** "Why does budget-tracking branch still exist after merge?"

**Answer:**
- **Remote branch** (GitHub): Deleted when you clicked "Delete branch" ✅
- **Local branch** (Your computer): Must be deleted manually ✅

**Commands Used:**
```bash
git checkout main              # Switch to main
git pull origin main          # Get merged changes
git branch -d feature/name    # Delete local branch
git fetch --prune            # Clean up remote refs
```

**Result:** Clean repository with feature fully integrated!
